 In milestone 2, I was having trouble with round up numbers to match the output. I was able to fix it using ceil() function. However, ceil() is only 
 available with <math.h> library which I cannot use due to the submitter program on Matrix. To fix the problem, I wrote a function called
 roundUp (line 451 - 465 in 144_ms2.c file) that replicates ceil() using the logic I found on google. The link was cited on the Milesstone 2
 in line 452 with explaination. Author name was not found.
 
 Other than that, I only used IPC textbook as main source for my logic, code examples and references. Some function such as
 clearKeyboard was taken from the textbook.
 
 No enhanced features were added. Outputs were strictly enforced by submitter.
