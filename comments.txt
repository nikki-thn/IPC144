In milestone 2, I was having trouble with round up numbers to match the output. I was able to fix it using ceil() function. However, ceil() is only available with <math.h> library which I cannot use due to the submitter program on Matrix. To fix the problem, I wrote a function called roundUp (line 451 - 465 in 144_ms2.c file) that replicates ceil() using the logic I found on google. The link was cited on the Milesstone 2 in line 452 with explaination. Author name was not found.
 
In addition, I use IPC textbook and my workshops exercise as main source for my logic, code examples and references. Some function such as flushKeyboard was taken from the textbook.
 
 
ENHANCEMENT:

Functions for option 6 (Delete items) and 7 (Search by named) are implemented. I also have modified the code so that when items are added or updated, changes will be saved onto the file.
